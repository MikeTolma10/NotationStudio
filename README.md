# NotationStudio
Michael Tolmajian created NotationStudio to support his passion for both music and software engineering. This program was designed using Microsoft's C# using Visual Studio Enterprise. 
## Compose
NotationStudio holds the basic features of a musical composition program but to a limited extent, from writing as short as sixteenth notes to configuring the largest time signatures.

### Create
The following musical elements are available for writing and editing in NotationStudio:
1) Notes and Rests (including dotted variations)
   - Whole
   - Half
   - Quarter (default selected)
   - Eighth
   - Sixteenth
2) Accidentals
   - Natural
   - Sharp
   - Flat
3) Time Signature
   - Beats per measure (Top Number)
   - Weight per beat (Bottom Number)
4) Tempo
   - Beats per minute, BPM (100 BPM on default)
5) Measures
   - Users can compose music up to 4 measures (more to be added)

### Playback
After composing desired music, this application allows the user to play back the notes they had written. This gives the user an opportunity to take their beautiful piece to a jam session!

## Comprehend
NotationStudio also provides NoteAnalyzer, a miniature program that gives the user a note to drag up/down the five-line staff. The note's frequency, as well as its respective major and minor root scales, are provided.
This allows for the users education on music theory to flourish!

## Trivia
1) NotationStudio took two months to create.
2) The program was a term project for a musical general education course.
3) Notes and rests were drawn by Michael Tolmajian, himself!
4) Math, math, math, and even more math was used for note placement and playback!
